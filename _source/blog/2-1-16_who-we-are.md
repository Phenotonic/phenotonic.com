title: 'Who We Are'

## We're Phenotonic. We're here to help.

Sustainability and organic practices matter to us. That's why we created Phenotonic. By supplying gardeners of all varieties and skill-levels with the best tools & services around, we saw a way to promote those ideals and improve the communities around us.

While working in the urban gardening industry, we consistently saw a certain group of people the industry ignored: non-professional growers. These growers are often sold solutions for gardens many sizes too large and not given the knowledge they need to succeed on their own. That's why we're starting with [the Bloom Box](/store/bloom-box), an organic (and compostable) CO2 generator perfect for the smaller indoor gardens.

We look forward to growing with you.
