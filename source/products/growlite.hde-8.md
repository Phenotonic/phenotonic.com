The first double-ended horticultural reflector suitable for both indoor and greenhouse applications. Flexibility within the unit, combined with end user functionality, makes this product one of a kind.

### What is Concealed Vacuum Airflow Technology?

The patented Concealed Vacuum Airflow Technology reflector utilizes 100% of the hood's reflective surface to maximize the lumens provided by the lamp. The parabolic reflectors stretch, bend and magnify the lamp’s internal components. No open ducts increases reflective surface area by 30%. Compared to standard designs, this patented reflector technology will create more uniform light nutrients, promoting larger yields at harvest time.

#### Features

* Includes 4-way, field-selectable 8” ducts, screens, or covers for full-sealed and non-sealed function and air-cooled and non air-cooled options
* Can be operated with lens for superior air-cooling, lamp and reflector protection or without lens for non air-cooled applications
* Superior photometric performance creates a greater amount of uniform light nutrients
* Re-designed K12x30S sockets make re-lamping easy
* Cooler lamps and housings reduce heat load issues and the costs associated with resolving them
* Exceptional housing quality ensures reliability and durability, minimizing down time due to maintenance and cleaning
* Durable powder coat finish
* Constructed of heavy-duty 22 gauge steel
* 1/8” thick tempered glass lens
* Removable door for easy lamp access and cleaning
* Standard w/15’ cord and ballast plug
* One (1) pair of V-hooks for mounting
* 400-1000w HPS DE standard or high frequency lamps
* Units with 1000w lamps generate 3700 BTU, 600w lamps generate 2200 BTU
* 650 to 875 CFM fan recommended for air cooling
