We made this box to give plants the happy life they deserve.

See, when plants first evolved, Earth’s atmosphere was rich in CO2. Plants practiced a lot, and got really good at splitting CO2 into it’s two main parts: carbon and oxygen. Unfortunately, they got a little too good at it, eventually reducing the CO2 in the atmosphere to a mere fraction of what it once was. Since plants need the energy stored in the carbon, they're always craving extra CO2.

Wanting CO2 makes plants sad. Don’t make your plants sad.
