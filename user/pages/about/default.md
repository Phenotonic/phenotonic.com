Sustainable practices and home gardening matter to us, so we created Phenotonic to promote organic sustainability and support gardeners with efficient, effective, & fresh amendments.

### What We Do

We aim to supply gardeners of all varieties and skill in the American Southwest with the best tools & knowledge available.

### Who We Are

We're two brothers hailing from Pheonix, Arizona. While working in the urban garden industry, we noticed a need for services and supplies geared towards the small, personal gardeners among us. We feel that we can make a positive impact on our communities by providing those services and supplies to gardeners.
