We made this box to give plants the happy life they deserve.

See, when plants first evolved, Earth's atmosphere was rich in CO<sub>2</sub>. Plants practiced a lot, and got really good at splitting CO<sub>2</sub> into it's two main parts: carbon and oxygen. Unfortunately, they got a little too good at it, eventually reducing the CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere to a mere fraction of what it once was.

This made the plants sad. Don't make your plants sad.
